Hey Everyone!  Welcome to the new version of my Ham Radio website.  I'm Jeremy, NQ0M and I'll be writing here about all kinds of ham radio things.  You might also get a little bit of computer-related info here as well, as I am an IT professional by trade, and very big into digital modes.

# A little bit about me:

I was originally licensed in 1993 with the callsign N0YAX.  I've also held the calls KK7IC, KF3EH, KF3EL, NW7JU, KE0MD, and N9PH.  I'm an avid contester, and try to work all the major HF contests.  I'm also fairly active in Parks On The Air (POTA), activating a number of parks across southeast Kansas.  I am blessed by a wonderful XYL who understands the hobby.  She is licensed as WA6CML, which was originally her grandfather's call (now SK).

# My current station equipment:

- Icom IC-7300
- MFJ-4230MVP power supply
- Princeton Antennas EF-53

# My current portable equipment:

- Yaesu FT-891
- Bioenno 20Ah LiFePo battery
- LDG AT-100Pro auto-tuner
- Various antennas (Hamstick, Wolf River Coils, Alpha Antenna)
